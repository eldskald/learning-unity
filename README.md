# Learning Unity

This is just me tinkering around the Unity features. Not a real game or project, but feel free to read and use the code as long as you give proper credits.

## Credits

At the start, it was a Unity adaptation of [this](https://gitlab.com/eldskald/3d-toon-resources) other project. Slowly, as I learned Unity's base tools, it became what it is now.
- Base toon shader made by following [this](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/) tutorial by Catlike Coding about rendering, everything adapted to become a cel shader. Some credit to [Roystan](https://roystan.net/articles/toon-shader.html#), [Harry Alisavakis](https://halisavakis.com/my-take-on-shaders-cel-shading/) for their versions of it and [GDQuest](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-shaders) for the 3D outlines.
- Planar reflections by me, more information on [this](https://youtu.be/w84-l3IEhXM) video. The repository is [here](https://github.com/eldskald/planar-reflections-unity).
- Volumetric lights by Michal Skalsky under BSD-3 license, [here](https://github.com/SlightlyMad/VolumetricLights) is the repository. Thank you to Michal Skalsky and all the contributors for this awesome project!
- Open simplex noise generators by KdotJPG, the repository is [here](https://github.com/KdotJPG/OpenSimplex2). His and the contributor's code is under CC0 public domain, so feel free to use it however you want!
- Fire shader by [Minions Art](https://www.patreon.com/posts/quick-game-art-27093551) with some slight modifications by me. WispyNoise.png by [GDQuest](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-shaders).
- Skybox shader by [Harry Alisavakis](https://halisavakis.com/my-take-on-shaders-sky-shader/), with a few modifications by me.
- Wind sway and water shaders are adaptations and lessons from many different sources, all of which use very similar techniques. I heavily modified them to adapt to my toon shader base code.
- Noise and gradient textures generators by me.
