# Learning Unity

This is just me tinkering around the Unity features. Not a real game or project, but feel free to read and use the code as long as you give proper credits.

## Credits

So far, everything is also from [this](https://gitlab.com/eldskald/3d-toon-resources) other project, by me but with loads of resources from other people. Check the credits. Specific lines of code are also credited on the comments of the file.
